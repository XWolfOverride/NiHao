NiHao
===============

A Lightweight but powerfull j2ee framework or java 1.6+

NiHao is a self-contained web application framework. it does not depends on any other framework or library more than the standard j2ee 6 runtime libraries and servlet container.
It was made with memory footprint and performance in mind, creating a fast, powerful and small framework with a ton of easy to use features.
Perfect for small or big j2ee web applications.
NiHao reimplements some useful features seen in other framewoks. But all integrated in only one framework for all.
Key features are:
· Context file configuration with wis own dialect (can be splitted into multiple files).
· Parametrized SQL in file, with object to parameter and result to object's auto mapping.
· Database changesets, allowing application to make all modifications desired on database on startup.
· Database engine related queryies. Sql and changesets can be separated by SQL engine. Allowing transparent SQL selection depending on the connected database.
· Worksets, A sesion-dependant data and logic objects, useful for navigation separated data sections.
· Ajax <-> Java transparent comuncation. Create application objects and methods that can be reflected into javascript.
· Integrated login/segurity structure, with a scalable login implementations.
· Own and scalable taglib. Automatically linked to the worksets allowing easy access to user data between pages.

All this features makes NiHao a great framework for fast and easy application development.
